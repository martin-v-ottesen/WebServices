\chapter{Who Did What}
\textcolor{red}{FROM HUBERT:\\
"It is important that with each section/subsection it is marked who is responsible for that part of the text. There can only be one responsible person for each part of the text. In addition, each WSDL, XSD, and BPEL file needs to have an author as well as all Java files (or other programming language file) used for implementing the simple Web services. In addition, you should list which author contributed to which section and which file in the section Who did what in the report.
\textit{Make sure that each member of the group does something of each task! In particular, but not exclu- sively, make sure that all of you work on the RESTful part as well as on the SOAP/BPEL part.}"\\
